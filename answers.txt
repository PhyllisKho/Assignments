1. How many earthquakes are listed in the table?

Unix command: wc -l signif.txt.tsv
Answer: 5959 signif.txt.tsv
The answer of 5959 lines includes the first line, which is headers. Hence, there are 5958 earthquakes.

2. How many columns are in the table?

Unix command: head -n 1 signif.txt.tsv | wc -w
Answer: 47

3. Use the cut command to create a new file that just has the data from the columns for YEAR, EQ_PRIMARY and COUNTRY. Hint: you can get the column numbers by using the head command to view the first row and then visually count the column numbers for the above fields (there is also a unix command to do this, but we didn't cover it in class). Call the new data file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv'. You can use 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv' for the rest of the exercises below.

Unix command:cut -d $'\t' -f 3,10,18 signif.txt.tsv > Year_Mag_Country.tsv

4. EQ_PRIMARY is the assigned earthquake magnitude. With your new file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv', sort the data based on the numeric value of the EQ_PRIMARY column, then list the lines for the top ten largest earthquakes.

Unix command: sort -t $'\t' -k 2 -g -r Year_Mag_Country.tsv | head -n 10
Answer: 
1960     9.5    CHILE
1964     9.2    USA
2011     9.1    JAPAN
2004     9.1    INDONESIA
1952     9.0    RUSSIA
1700     9.0    USA
2010     8.8    CHILE
1812     8.8    USA
1716     8.8    PERU
1965     8.7    USA

5. How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this question.

Unix command: cut -d $'\t' -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort -t $'\t' | uniq | wc -l
Answer: 154
The header, 'COUNTRY', is included in the line count. Therefore, there are 153 unique countries. 

6. Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the database are located in the USA or USA TERRITORY

Unix command: cut -d $'\t' -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep USA | wc -l
Answer: 294

7. Expanding on the previous exercise, refine your command sequence so that it only counts earthquakes in the USA and not ones in USA TERRITORY. Hint: use the -v argument with grep and you may need to call grep more than once.

Unix command: cut -d $'\t' -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep USA | grep -v -c 'USA TERRITORY'
Answer: 255

8. Compute the total number of earthquakes in each country and then display the top ten countries along with the number of earthquakes. Hint: this can be done with a command sequence similar to exercise 5, but requires a specific argument to be used with uniq.

Unix command: cut -d $'\t' -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | head -n 10
Answer:
579 CHINA
400 JAPAN
365 IRAN
363 INDONESIA
324 ITALY
319 TURKEY
259 GREECE
255 USA
207 PHILIPPINES
193 MEXICO

9. Create a shell script named countEq.sh that returns the total number of earthquakes for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Hint: see the Shell Script notes and use the special variable $1. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country USA.

Script:
#!/bin/bash

country_EQ=$1
file=Year_Mag_Country.tsv

cut -d $'\t' -f 3 $file | sort -t $'\t' | uniq -c | sort -n -r | grep $1

Calling sequence for country USA:
bash countEq.sh USA

Answer:
255 USA
39 USA TERRITORY


10. Create a shell script named countEq_getLargestEq.sh that returns both the total number of earthquakes AND the largest earthquake for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Use the echo command before each command to create labels for each returned value. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country CHILE.

Script:
#!/bin/bash

country_LargestEq=$1
file=Year_Mag_Country.tsv

echo Total number of earthquakes in the country:

cut -d $'\t' -f 3 $file | sort -t $'\t' | uniq -c | sort -n -r | grep $1 

echo Largest earthquake in the country:

sort -t $'\t' -k 3 $file | grep $1 | sort -t $'\t' -n -k 2 | tail -n 1

Calling sequence for country CHILE:
bash countEq_getLargestEq.sh CHILE

Answer:
Total number of earthquakes in the country:
    192 CHILE
Largest earthquake in the country:
1960     9.5    CHILE

11. Compute the total number of earthquakes each year and then output a sorted list of the top ten years with the most earthquakes. Paste your command and the top ten list below.

Unix command:
cut -d $'\t' -f 1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | uniq -c | sort -n -r | head -n 10

Answer:
78 2004
77 2008
72 2003
67 2007
62 2010
61 2006
60 2009
60 2005
60 2002
59 2011

12. Turn in your homework by sharing it with us on a GitHub repository. Instructions: on GitHub, create a private git repository called Assignment_2. Share this repository with users graheja  and dmw2166. Clone the repository to your laptop. Save your answers to the exercises above in a text file called answers.txt. Use git to commit answers.txt to your repository on your laptop, and then push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
